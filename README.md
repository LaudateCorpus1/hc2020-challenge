### The Challenge

We would like you to write a game for Avast Secure Browser, taking the theme of 101 and adding a pinch of security or privacy. The game should be playable when the browser is offline, so we're looking for something that a player can engage with quickly and then enjoy for as long as they like. Feel free to use JavaScript and the HTML5 canvas, a framework like melonJS, or an engine of your choice.

Not only will members of the winning team each take home a Nintendo Switch, but we're also looking to fill paid internship positions at Avast's central London office. Dazzle us in Cambridge and you could be invited to come and integrate your game into Avast Secure Browser, where it will be played by millions around the globe!

So, are you ready to take on our challenge and impress us with your creation?

We'll be looking for creativity, playability, clean code, and great teamwork as well as keeping an eye out for games that really nail our themes of 101, security and privacy.

More info and background on the challenge can be found on our [website](https://hc2020.avastbrowser.com/).

### Getting Started

##### 1. Install Avast Secure Browser

You can download the very latest version of our browser on our official website: [here](https://www.avast.com/secure-browser).

##### 2. Choose your game engine or framework

We have provided two examples games using different engines:

- [HTML Game Template](https://github.com/avast/hc2020-challenge/tree/master/HTML%20Game%20Template) (engineless) - sample game that uses the HTML5 canvas and raw JavaScript
- [CCleaner Space Invaders](https://github.com/avast/hc2020-challenge/tree/master/melonjs) (melonJS) - sample game that uses the melonJS framework

##### 3. Install Useful Applications

You may want to install some of these useful applications to improve your team's speed and efficiency of development:

###### Virtual Machines

We recommend using a virtual machine to create a sandboxed environment. You can use one of the following Virtual Machine platforms:

-   [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/download/) _(recommended)_
-   [VMWare (Windows/Linux)](https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html)
-   [VMWare (Mac)](https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/fusion/fusion-evaluation.html)
-   [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

_Important Note:_ While VirtualBox is free it often performance less well, so a trial of Parallels or VMWare may be a better choice. If you are unfamiliar with Virtual Machines, you can learn more from the wiki page located [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine).

###### Virtual Machine Images

Once you have chosen your preferred Virtual Machine provider, you will need to setup a Windows Virtual Image. Microsoft make pre-prepped packages available for download within their [Dev Center](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines). Alternatively, you can download free evaulation copies of Windows for 90 days from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-10-enterprise).

_Important Note:_ Virtual machines are great for sandboxed environments, snapshotting and jumping between saved states, but be careful not to lose your work!

###### Version Control

Version control software allows you to manage code (especially in a team) and keep track of your development work:

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/) _(strongly recommended)_
-   [TortoiseSVN](https://tortoisesvn.net/)
-   [Mercurial SCM](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)

Assuming you chose Git for version control, you may wish to check out [this great list](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) of GUI clients. When working with Git in your challenge team, remember to:

-   Create feature branches for your work (branched from `master`).
-   Commit your changes (including commenting your code!)
-   Write or adapt tests as needed to verify your application
-   Add or change the documentation as needed

_Important Note:_ if you do not chose to work with Git that's fine, however you may require more time to submit your work at the end of the challenge (see _[Finishing Up](#finishing-up)_)

###### Text Editors / IDEs

You'll need a reliable and feature rich text editor / IDE to write your code:

-   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended)
-   [Atom](https://atom.io/)
-   [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
-   [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)

###### Linux on Windows

The latest Windows 10 versions supports an Ubuntu Linux subsystem. If you are more comfortable with a Unix-like shell, this may help speed up your development within Windows:

-   [Ubuntu subsystem](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows#0) (recommended)
-   [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

### Submit Your Hack

In order to help us judge your work more effectively, we'd like to get a good view of the code you have written as a team. We use [Devpost](https://ternary.devpost.com/) for hack submissions - you can sign up [here](https://secure.devpost.com/users/register?ref_content=signup_avast&ref_feature=signup&ref_medium=github).

Before submitting, make sure you have completed the following:

- Every member of your team needs to have a Devpost account.
- Only one person needs to submit the hack: to do this click ‘Enter a Submission’.
- Provide a good overview of what you’ve developed in the description field. This will be used as criteria to assess your hack. You can use screenshots if you wish.
- Enter your team members’ Devpost accounts.
- Choose the challenge or challenges you have entered.

***Warning:*** You must submit your hack before hacking ends at **Sunday 19th January 2020 @ 12:01:00 GMT/UTC**, including all relevant source code.
